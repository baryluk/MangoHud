# Making all fields pointers is a bit inefficient.
# It would be best to only do so for strings, repeated fields,
# not scalar primitives.
#
# Right now there is no easy way to do this by type, only by name.
#
# Either here in .options file, or using (nanopb).type annotations
# on each file, or using `-s type:FT_POINTER` flag to compiler.
